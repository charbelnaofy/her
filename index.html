                Dear Naof,
                When you're reading this its going to be your 25th birthday...which is basically 30. lol..Ok sorry. 
                I love you bby. And for once im going to be serious and open up. I told you before that at the start of the relationship
                I didn't take it seriously. It was because i was afraid that I actually found someone i can love and give all of myself to. 
                I was afraid because i didn't know how i would deal with that vulnerability and having to let go of my paranoia and anxiety. 
                But you taught me to let go of my insecurities and accept that love. Accept that i have someone that loves me and someone that i love. 
                Everyday you remind me to get over that fear and give you my all. Everyday i know that i have someone that accepts and understands me no matter what I do or go through,
                and the same goes for you. Everyday you make me fall in love with you again. Everyday despite of life's routine and its numbing effect there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, and that is you naof. Your love is the only thing that makes life special. 
                I want to be the person you can come to and share all your worries with. I never want you to ever feel alone again, to ever feel like you have to deal with something by yourself, i want to be the person that you can always depend on, because thats what you are to me.
                And everyday we have to make sacrifices towards maintaining our love and friendship. That is what falling in love everyday entails. I will sacrifice everything i have to everyday to keep you. I love you and i never want you to feel like you have to suffer alone. 
                That is what love is, facing life together, unconditionally. I couldn't believe that someone i met online would have a personality i can really connect with. The time i spend with you always feels makes me feel like i can just forget about my worries and insecurities and just enjoy your presence. 
                I love everything about you bby, i can't think of a life without you, and without seeing your beautiful face and hearing ur voice. You are the only person i can be honest with and i hope its the same for you. Sorry i rambled but i was just saying what comes to my mind when i think about you. I love you naof. 
                I will be here for you whenever you need me. You are my other lost half. and Thank God for that dumbass server that got us to meet each other. I love you baby and may you have the best birthday, i wish i was there to celebrate it with you ❤️   

                Love,
                Charbel
